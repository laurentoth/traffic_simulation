Traffic Flow Simulator: Requirements Document
1. Background
   The client is requesting this software in preparation for the use of
   autonomous cars that are secure from outside signals to prevent horrific
   interactions with hackers, yet that also avoid collisions with all other 
   autonomous cars.
2. Description of Software
   This software will simulate the traffic in a city consisting of parallel and 
   perpendicular streets whose crossovers create intersections. Each street has
   two, one-way directed segments where each segment consists of many slots for
   each of which one car can occupy. The autonomous cars navigate these
   streets following the designated traffic rules. The client will use this
   software to find the average time it takes for an autonomous car to get from 
   starting point to ending destination. This software simulation will take in
   input parameters for the city grid size, approximate rate of entry of cars,
   and entry and exit locations of each car. These input parameters can be user
   entered or randomly determined. The output data provided by the simulation
   can be used by the client to better develop a traffic control plan. The GUI
   and virtual reality goggles initially required by the client will not be
   included in the software, as their inclusion would inordinately add to the
   time and monetary cost to develop the software, and as the expected purpose
   of the software can still be achieved without a GUI or virtual reality
   goggles.
3. Environmental Characteristics
   (You need put nothing in this section at this time, but have such a
   section heading; the section might eventually describe such things as the 
   operating system that could be used, the version of compilers used, etc.)
4. Simulation Characteristics
   4.1 Geographic layout
       4.1.1 The city section is a grid of up to 20 north-south two-way streets 
             and 20 east-west two-way streets.
       etc.
   4.2 Traffic control devices
       4.2.1 Intersections controlled by rules rather than control devices.
             These rules are enforced between the cars through the visual
             communication of the cars' turn signals, which signal the way that
             car is going to turn (the car will turn left only if the turn 
             signal on the left is lit; the car will turn right only if the 
             turn signal on the right is lit; the car will move straight if no
             turn signals are lit):
             4.2.1.1 When the current intersection path of a car or the slot 
                     immediately after the intersection path is occupied by one 
                     or more cars, the car will not move. Otherwise, the car has
                     the potential opportunity to move.
             4.2.1.2 When only one car with the potential opportunity to move is
                     at the current intersection:
                     4.2.1.2.1 When no car is in the intersection, the car at
                               the intersection will move.
                     4.2.1.2.2 When one or more cars are in the current
                               intersection, and none of the intersection paths
                               of those cars overlap with the intersection path
                               of the car at the intersection, the car at the
                               intersection will move. Otherwise, the car at the 
                               intersection will NOT move.
             4.2.1.3 When more than one car with the potential opportunity to
                     move is at the current intersection:
                     4.2.1.3.1 When any of the intersection paths of the cars at 
                               the intersection overlap AND any of those cars'
                               routes are the same type of turn: 
                               Of the cars in contention, a car's priority is
                               determined by the direction of that car's current
                               segment slot where Southbound has priority over
                               Eastbound, which has priority over Northbound,
                               which has priority over Westbound.
                     4.2.1.3.2 When any of the intended intersection paths of 
                               the cars at the intersection overlap AND any of 
                               those cars' routes are NOT the same type of turn: 
                               Of the cars in contention, a car's priority is
                               determined by the type of turn where Straight has
                               priority over Right, which has priority over Left
                     4.2.1.3.3 When any of the intersection paths of the cars at 
                               the intersection DON'T overlap:
                               Concurrency is allowed.

   4.3 Traffic flow 
       4.3.1 Speed of traffic
             4.3.1.1 All cars travel at the same speed.
             That speed is given by timeToTraverseSegment.

             eventually don't say something vague like "six or seven traffic 
             patterns will define the traffic flow", instead describe -- 
             using *separate* outline numbering for each such pattern
             -- all the traffic flow patterns that exist in the simulation and 
             thus are available to the user; you need not mention the various
             specific places where a car could actually make a turn)

5. Input/Output
   (specific description of input and output formats and how the
   client will provide input and receive output; client has already indicated 
   whether he wants a graphical view and/or GUI input and output to the overall 
   software.)
6. Life Cycle Considerations
   6.1 Subsets
       6.1 Subsets

       6.1.1 The first deliverable will be a program which receives input from
             the user about cars being placed inside the city grid and echo
             print that input back to the user

       6.1.2 The second deliverable will be a program which receives input from
             the user about cars being placed inside the city grid and actually
             creates a simulation with the cars placed in the appropriate
             segments. The program will also run through an iteration of the
             simulation, processing the intersections in the proper order, left
             to right across rows from bottom to top. Cars will be moved based
             on the assumptions that cars can traverse segments and
             intersections instantaneously, that segments have unlimited
             capacity, and that there is no contention between cars at
             intersections. For each intersection designated by its column and
             row number, in the order that the intersections are processed,
             the program will first print that intersection's coordinates. Next
             in order of direction SOUTHWARD, EASTWARD, NORTHWARD, then
             WESTWARD, the program will print whether the incoming segment from
             that direction is empty or nonempty before any cars have been moved
             by that intersection, and if a segment is nonempty the program will
             also print to which outgoing segment the car in that incoming
             segment is moved and also print a message if that car leaves the
             grid. Then when that intersection has moved all cars appropriately,
             the program will print for each outgoing segment, in the same order
             of direction, whether that segment is empty or nonempty.

   6.2 Possible extensions

       view of the client's longer-term needs)

7. Glossary
   7.1 A "direction" is exactly one of the following: N, W, S, E.
       Those letters abbreviate North, West, South, East, respectively.
   7.2 A "section" is the portion of a street between two adjacent 
       intersections.  
       7.2.1 Each section consists of exactly two segments that aim in opposite
             directions from each other.
   7.3 A "segment" is the portion of a section going in a single direction that
       consists of multiple slots.
   7.4 A "slot" is the smallest, directed unit of a segment or one quadrant of
       the two-by-two grid created by an intersection. At most one car may
       occupy a slot at a given time unit.
       7.4.1 An "intersection slot" refers to one slot in the intersection.
       7.4.2 A "segment slot" refers to one slot in a given segment.
   7.5 A "route" is the predetermined path a car will take to get from starting
       position to the end destination.
   7.6 A "traffic rule" or "traffic law" is a rule that all cars in the system
       must follow as the car completes a route.
   7.7 A "time unit" is the user-determined time measurement where each car
       will either move one slot per time unit or stay at rest for the time
       unit.
   7.8 A "simulation" is one run of the software that starts, ends, and provides
       output to the user.
   7.9 A "user" is the person running the software at any given time.
   7.10 A "GUI" is the graphical representation of the simulation.
   7.11 A "destination" is a given point in the grid system that is an ending
        point where a car exits the grid during the simulation.
   7.12 An "average" is the sum of the amounts of time each car that completed
        its route took to travel from that car's starting point to that car's 
        destination, divided by the total number of cars that completed their
        routes.
   7.13 An "intersection" is a region adjacent to four sections, creating a
        two-by-two grid of slots.
   7.14 An "autonomous car" is a car that is able to sense the surrounding
        environment through sensors, follows the given traffic laws, and 
        navigates without any human assistance.
   7.15 An "intersection path" of a car consists of the intersection slots the
        car will be in to advance along its route strictly through the current
        intersection.
   7.16 The segment slot that is "immediately after" an intersection path is the
        first segment slot a car will occupy after leaving the current
        intersection.
   7.17 When a car is "at an intersection", the car occupies the last segment
        slot on the car's route and the next slot the car will occupy is the 
        first slot in the car's current intersection path.
   7.18 When a car is "in the intersection", the car occupies one of the four
        intersection slots.
   7.19 "Concurrency" is when two or more cars will move through an intersection
        during the same time unit because each car's intersection path
        is not in contention with all other cars' intersection paths.
   7.20 When a car "moves", the car advances one slot along the car's current
        route during the current time unit.
   7.21 A car has two parts that are "turn signals", where one turn signal is
        located on the left side of the car and the other turn signal is located
        on the right side.
        7.21.1 When a turn signal "is lit", the car is indicating the direction
               the car will travel through the current intersection where all
               other cars are able to see another car's signal.
        7.21.2 When a car is at an intersection and neither of the turn signals
               are lit, the car will travel straight through the intersection.
   7.22 Two segments "aim in opposite directions from each other" if and only if
         exactly one of the following holds:
        7.22.1 One segment aims Northward, and the other aims Southward
        7.22.2 One segment aims Eastward, and the other aims Westward
