We have added, to the requirements document, an additional entry to the
glossary with header 7.23 for the term "time to traverse segment". This entry
serves to clarify the meaning intended by the client and as it has been
clarified to us in a recent email by Dr. C.

We have also added sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 that detail the life cycle
considerations of the ast two subsets, subsets 3 and 4 respectively.

In the requirements document, the description in subset 4 does *not* agree with
our implementation, insofaras it does not exhibit the correct behavior of
advancing time units given by the example table in section 6.1.4.

67-73 of Car.java:
The nonconforming implementation of advanceOneTimeUnit() read the following:
------ BEGIN NONCONFORMANT IMPLEMENTATION OF advanceOneTimeUnit() --------
  public void advanceOneTimeUnit(){
    if(!hasMovedThisTimeStep){
      myTimeOnGrid++;
    } // end of if(!hasMovedThisTimeStep)

    myRemainingTimeOnSeg--;    
  } // end of advanceOneTimeUnit()
------- END NONCONFORMANT IMPLEMENTATION OF advanceOneTimeUnit() ---------

The fixed implementation would be the following:
---------- BEGIN FIXED IMPLEMENTATION OF advanceOneTimeUnit() ------------
  public void advanceOneTimeUnit(){
    if(!hasMovedThisTimeStep){
      myTimeOnGrid++;
      myRemainingTimeOnSeg--;
    } // end of if(!hasMovedThisTimeStep)
    
  } // end of advanceOneTimeUnit()
----------- END FIXED IMPLEMENTATION OF advanceOneTimeUnit() -------------

note the differing positions of the line:   myRemainingTimeOnSeg--;
